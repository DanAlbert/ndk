Android Native Development Kit (NDK)
====================================

Welcome, this NDK is designed to allow Android application developers to include
native code in their Android application packages, compiled as JNI shared
libraries.

See [the Getting Started Guide](docs/Getting_Started/html/index.html) for an
introduction.

See [the changelist](docs/Change_Log.html) for a list of changes since the
previous release.

We recommend developers to make themselves familiar with JNI concepts. Also note
that the NDK is **not** a good way to write non-JNI native code for the Android
platform.

If you need to build the NDK itself, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

Finally, discussions related to the Android NDK happen on the
[android-ndk](http://groups.google.com/group/android-ndk) Google Group.
